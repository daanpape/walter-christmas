# Walter christmas lights

I'm playing around with a [Walter module](https://www.quickspot.io/) connected 
to a string of WS2812B christmas lights. The goal is to create a webpage that 
I can use to control the color of the LEDs. Throug a 
[BlueCherry.io](https://www.bluecherry.io) IoT connection over LTE-M I should be
able to get relatively low latency.

This is a picture of my test setup:
